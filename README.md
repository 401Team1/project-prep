Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

If at any point we need each other to voice when we arent grasping a concept. Then we can analyze components that arent making sense and work together to get everyone on the same page.

### Conflict Plan

What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

The process would be to hear all perspectives and discuss how to resolve it.

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

We will express our concerns of being excluded from the project, and we will be open and try to find a solution we can all agree on.

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

We are a team, and we will all strive to do our best at our own pace! Its okay to do things at different paces but communication is key.

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

First discuss our concerns with the members and see if theres a resolution we can come to.

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

If unsuccessful, have our instructor mediate a possible resolution for the group.

### Communication Plan

What hours will you be available to communicate?

9am-6pm

What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

Slack and discord

How often will you take breaks?

Whenever we see fit, sometimes the work keeps flowing and others we need to just step away to recollect our thoughts.

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

Lock down and set what we need to accomplish on what day before we end our collaboration day.

How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

We can reach out through phones, slack or discord since most have the mobile app as well.

What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

When discussing a topic we will have everyone lay out their opinions and ideas and just come to a vote on which path to take.

How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

Having a good connection with your peers and everyone has an openness to different ways of thinking.

### Work Plan

How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

We will work together to create a list of tasks, and identify any other tasks we will need to do, then we will work together to figure out the best way to complete all of them or how to split tasks between eachother.

What project management tool will be used?

GitHub, Trello and Discord. We will keep in touch and communicate as much as possible.

### Git Process

What components of your project will live on GitHub?

Majority if not all of the project.

How will you share the repository with your teammates?

Created an organization so everyone has ownership of the repository.

What is your Git flow?

Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
How many people must review a PR?

We are going to have 1 person review

Who merges PRs?

Whoever is the last to approve the PR.

How often will you merge?

Once we’ve successfully implemented any features then we will ACP and merge.
